### 📝 내용
I am working on a research project for my university, for which we need a knowledge base. Among other things, this should contain transcripts of various YouTube videos on specific topics. For this purpose, I am using a Python program with the YouTubeTranscriptApi library.
    
      However, YouTube rejects further requests after 24, so that I am timed out or banned from my IP (I don't know exactly what happens there).
    
      In any case, my professor is convinced that there is an official API from Google (which probably costs money) that can be used to download such transcripts on a large scale. As I understand it, the YouTube Data API v3 is not suitable for this purpose.
    
      Since I have not found such an API, I would like to ask if anyone here knows anything about this and could tell me which API he specifically means.

### 📝 내용
Tired of watching 20-minute YouTube videos for 2 minutes of actual value?
    
      I built a free tool that extracts YouTube subtitles instantly - no more time wasting!
    
      The Problem We All Face:
    
      - Clickbait titles with 20-minute videos that could be 2-minute reads
    
      - Foreign language videos that look interesting but you can't understand
    
      - No way to preview content before committing your time
    
      My Solution: I created  YouTube Subtitle Extractor, so you can:
    
      - Preview content first → Only watch videos worth your time
    
      - Understand any language → Foreign videos are no longer a barrier
    
      - Save hours daily → Quickly scan content before watching
    
      No signup, no payment.

Do you also have the same problem that auto subtitles on YouTube no longer work?
    
      They worked a few days ago, but now they just show a black dot or nothing.
    
      I tried translating from English to Croatian, but now it doesn’t work anymore for some reason.
    
      I tried Chrome and Firefox, both don´t work.
    
      Just to know if i am not alone and if its a bug that affects everyone.
    
      EDIT:
    
      Firefox works somehow but Chrome doesn't, you can try it.

### 📝 내용
Hey everyone 👋
    
      Hey all — I’ve been working on a tool that automates transcript extraction from YouTube videos and playlists.
    
      🎉 I just released a simple tool that lets you extract and download full transcripts (a.k.a. scripts) from YouTube videos or entire playlists. You can download them in multiple formats like plain text, subtitles, or line-by-line dialogue.
    
      It helps with tasks like turning videos into blogs, saving content for research, or feeding YouTube audio into your AI pipelines.
    
      Everyone gets 50 free credits/month, no signup needed just to try it out.
    🧠 Why I built this:
      I’ve always found it frustrating how hard it is to just get the script from a YouTube video — especially when doing research, learning, summarizing, or reusing your own content. YouTube has aggressive bot protection, so scraping reliably at scale is tricky (and breaks easily). I spent a lot of time fine-tuning this.
    🔜 What’s next:
        
      
      A public API for devs and automation fans
    
    
      
      AI-generated summaries, extracted key points, and even video "topic/problem detectors"
    
    
      
      More export formats (Word, Notion blocks? if there will be requests)
    
    
      
      Possibly browser extensions to save to your workspace instantly
    
    
      
      I might include AI transcribing if there are no scripts by author provided
    
    
      🚀 Who might find this useful:
        
      
      Content creators (e.g., reuse scripts, turn videos into blogs)
    
    
      
      Language learners and students
    
    
      
      Researchers who prefer reading over watching
    
    
      
      Anyone building AI tools on top of YouTube content
    
    
      👉 Would love your feedback or feature requests.
        
      
      What other formats would be useful to you?
    
    
      
      Is there something missing that would make this way more useful?
    
    
      
      UX feedback? Pricing? Anything helps!
    
    
      
      Thanks in advance! 🙏YouTubeTranscribes

I'm not a coder but playing with lovable to build an app I've always wanted - I need to get access to the captions/subtitles from a youtube video - usually a podcast - to summarise the video.
    
      I;ve been trying for ages - youtube API doesn't work only gives metadata. I tried Gladia, YouTube Data API, and it even walked me through using replit to build a custom youtube-transcript-api as primary source
    
      Nothing works. I'd rather not have to have it generate a transcript every time - is there any way to get access to the subtitle captions? I know I have seen chrome plugins do this on youtube.
    
      Any suggestions?

      Hey all — I’ve been working on a tool that automates transcript extraction from YouTube videos and playlists. Recently included AI features to Summarize video, extract Key Timestamps, Key problems and generate keywords.

      It helps with tasks like turning videos into blogs, saving content for research, or feeding YouTube audio into your AI pipelines.
    
      Everyone gets 50 free credits/month, no signup needed just to try it out.
    🧠 Why I built this:
      I’ve always found it frustrating how hard it is to just get the script from a YouTube video — especially when doing research, learning, summarizing, or reusing your own content. YouTube has aggressive bot protection, so scraping reliably at scale is tricky (and breaks easily). I spent a lot of time fine-tuning this.
    
      Current main features:
    
        
      
      Download scripts in text, json, srt formats
    
    
      
      A public API for devs and automation fans
    
    
      
      AI-generated summaries, extracted key points, and even video "topic/problem detectors"
    
    
      🔜 What’s next:
        
      
      More export formats (Word, Notion blocks? if there will be requests)
    
    
      
      Possibly browser extensions to save to your workspace instantly
    
    
      
      I might include AI transcribing if there are no scripts by author provided
    
    
      🚀 Who might find this useful:
        
      
      Content creators (e.g., reuse scripts, turn videos into blogs)
    
    
      
      Language learners and students
    
    
      
      Researchers who prefer reading over watching
    
    
      
      Anyone building AI tools on top of YouTube content
    
    
      👉 Would love your feedback or feature requests.
        
      
      What other formats would be useful to you?
    
    
      
      Is there something missing that would make this way more useful?
    
    
      
      UX feedback? Pricing? Anything helps!
    
    
      
      Thanks in advance! 🙏YouTubeTranscribes

on very few videos, it can generate pretty good to near perfect subtitles
    
      otherwise it's just messed up, out of sync, and even misinterpreting words
    
      maybe they're improving the auto subtitles on certain languages just now, i have no idea

### 📝 내용
I'm working on a project where users enter a YouTube video URL, and I want to extract the captions (subtitles) from that video.
    
      I tried using youtube-transcript, and while it works, I’m now getting errors like:
    
      
    
      Seems like it's rate-limited by IP by YouTube.
    
      My app is in JavaScript (frontend and/or backend), and I’m trying to find a more stable way to get captions without relying on the official YouTube API (to avoid the daily quota limits).
    
      Are there any free and reliable JS libraries, or server-side tools (e.g., via Node.js), that can extract subtitles more reliably?
    
      Appreciate any tips or alternatives!

Hi team, Just wanted to flag a potential issue: until recently, VoxScript was working perfectly when extracting subtitles/transcripts from YouTube videos — even auto-generated ones. But now, it shows the message “The creator has disabled subtitles” on every video I try, even ones that worked just fine a few days ago.
    
      This makes me think something broke in the backend or that YouTube changed something in their transcript API. Could you please look into it? It doesn’t seem likely that every creator disabled captions all at once.
    
      Thanks in advance — love what you’re building!

### 📝 내용
I created Rustitles, a GUI tool based on Subliminal to scan a given folder and batch download all missing subtitles. You could accomplish the same thing with subliminal and a powershell script, but this is here for anyone that wants a simple GUI app to find subtitles automatically.
    
      I'm aware of other options like TinyMediaManager or FileBot, but these apps are either paid, confusing for the average user, or are mainly used for other functions. I am also aware that emby has automatic subtitle downloading as an option, but it has never worked properly for me for whatever reason.
    
      This is for Windows & Linux

      -Edit-Release History:V1.0.4

      Added progress indicator below jobs output
    
    
      
      Changed "Subtitle Jobs" -> "Subliminal Jobs" to be more accurate
    
    
      
      UI refreshes more often, should seem more responsive
    
    
      
      v2.1.1

### 📝 내용
Hey r/replit crew! 👋
    
      I've been lurking here for a while, inspired by posts like that 10-year coding vet sharing hard-earned wisdom or the non-dev founder hyping their passion project. As a solo dev tinkering on Replit, I just wrapped up a fun (and frustrating) journey building a YouTube subtitle extractor.
    
      It's live at https://youtube.impact.pe.kr – totally free, no sign-up, and it pulls subtitles in seconds so you can "read" videos instead of wasting time on clickbait. But dude, the dev process was a rollercoaster. Let me spill the beans in a quick, entertaining recap – think tech drama with proxy battles, bounty hunts, and triumphant speed boosts!
    The Spark: Why Build This?
      Started back in June 2025. I hated slogging through 20-min YouTube videos for 2 mins of gold, especially foreign ones. Solution? A tool that grabs subtitles instantly, supports 10 languages (English, Korean, Japanese, etc.), and even lets you preview before watching. Built it multilingual from the get-go – initial screens in each lang, video info on the side, combo boxes for switching subtitles (with "manual" vs "auto-generated" tags). Used Flask on Replit for the backend, yt-dlp and youtube-transcript-api for extracting video info and subtitles.
    The Fun Begins: Replit Honeymoon Phase
        
      
      Early Wins: Whipped up the MVP in days. Dev env was buttery smooth – enter a URL, boom, subtitles with video title, channel, views, etc. Added history features: your personal "watched" list (click URL bar to see/delete) and a global "recent extracts" section for community vibes. Even cached subtitles to avoid hammering YouTube (smart, right?).
    
    
      
      Design Tweaks Gone Wild: Started with a simple UI inspired by clean apps. Added progress bars that "grow" in stages for that satisfying load feel. Fixed duplicate text glitches (like subtitles repeating chunks – turns out API quirks with line merging). Threw in a cute cloud icon for the title because why not?
    
    
      The Plot Twists: Replit Deployment Drama
      Oh boy, deploy to a custom domain (youtube.impact.pe.kr) and everything broke. Subtitles? Nope. Video info? Vanished. Error logs screamed "YouTube blocking your IP!" – turns out Replit's cloud IPs are persona non grata on YouTube. Cue the panic:
    
        
      
      Proxy Wars: Tried free proxies – Blocked by Youtube. My Oracle Cloud server(Free tier) Proxy setup using Squid? Blocked too. Even hit up Webshare (paid, rotating IPs) – worked like a charm at 4-7s response times, but bandwidth costs? Oof, forecast 1.6GB in testing alone. Ditched it for my other server proxy – success! But not before a hilarious 15-20s lag spike that felt like dial-up.
    
    
      
      Bounty Hunter Mode: Posted a $50 bounty on Replit Bounties after Get Help was meh. Four applicants ghosted, but then a Nigerian dev jumped in: "Stop your dev env – it's clashing proxies!" Boom, fixed intermittent errors. Later, a Saudi dev nailed another 100$ bounty – swapped to pure youtube-transcript-api, slashing response from 40-50s to 5-7s. No more internal server errors! Felt like leveling up in a game.
    
    
      
      Extra Fixes: Prevented history duplicates(video ID + lang unique). Even added Adsense for sustainability – gotta cover those Replit costs!

      Features That Stuck: Subtitle copy/download, no-start/duration (just clean text), paginated history (20/page). Global history shows recent extracts across users – anonymized, of course. Sitemap submitted to Google, favicon added, even linked it on my dic.impact.pe.kr site.
    
    
      
      Launch Buzz: Posted on r/SideProject – 223 views in 2 hours, one comment! Dropped comments on Google-searched subtitle extractor blogs (Naver, Brunch) with my link. I posted on the Thread for the first time, and while a friend gave it a like, barely anyone read it.
    
    
      
      Looking back, Replit was the perfect playground – Dev Preview for quick tests, easy deploys, and that bounty system saved my bacon. If you're a non-tech founder like the other post, start small with Replit. Try it out: https://youtube.impact.pe.kr (English default, switch langs via combo). Feedback? Suggestions? Hit me up!

- **내용**: You're right that Google’s API used to allow subtitle access, but things have changed. Google’s API now limits subtitle access to videos you own, with a 10,000-unit daily cap.

### 📝 내용
Tired of watching 20-minute YouTube videos for 2 minutes of actual value?
    
      I built a free tool that extracts YouTube subtitles instantly - no more time wasting!
    
      The Problem We All Face:
    
      - Clickbait titles with 20-minute videos that could be 2-minute reads
    
      - Foreign language videos that look interesting but you can't understand
    
      - No way to preview content before committing your time
    
      My Solution: I created  YouTube Subtitle Extractor, so you can:
    
      - Preview content first → Only watch videos worth your time
    
      - Understand any language → Foreign videos are no longer a barrier
    
      - Save hours daily → Quickly scan content before watching
    
      No signup, no payment.

Youtube has the best audio to text auto translate as one would see in any selected youtube video.
    
      Though I've tried to get a result from this I'm always doing something wrong.
