I have personally googled for this and while there are apps that do this, not really interested in paying a subscription for it. What I do normally is use of the websites online and get the transcript for the video with the link, put it into ChatGPT to summarize it for me or what I prefer is bullet points.

There is one other shortcut I’ve see but it requires a key from ChatGPT which I believe comes with a subscription only? Wondering if there is a shortcut that can do it without that, since I can manually do it for free but it’ll save the steps if a shortcut can do that instead

Ok, this is my first desktop app built entirely using GitHub Copilot in Agent mode. With a valid API key from google, you can download transcripts from any YouTube channel where they have them and haven't blocked them. I initially built this as a proof of concept for myself to help me validate my own titles and descriptions but given its ease of use and capability, I want to share with people.

You can download all videos, top 5 or specific videos using comma seperated values. You can output JSON which contains title, description, url, like count, comment count and detailed transcript or TEXT which is just the transcript OR BOTH 😉

The tool can search for the channel ID by channel name.

The tool can store your API key and Channel ID locally on the machine - \*disclaimer\* this is in plain text and so it is saved at your own risk.

The download folder defaults to your default folder but you can browse and open the location to view the downloads.

There is basic error handling and dark

Russ Vought is directly connected to what has been happening in recent weeks — a global push for new restrictions that threaten anime, manga, and video games.

They want to dismantle Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants online platforms immunity from liability for what their users post. Removing this would shift responsibility from users to platform operators, using threats and financial regulatory pressure. The result: massive over-censorship, fewer online communities, and severe limits on creative expression.

This isn’t just about a few games — it affects all user-generated content, from fan art and mods to anime and manga discussion spaces.

Here’s the original investigative video: \[[the video](https://youtu.be/0noIS9lmR0Y?si=UrnrgfD-ZqVHJDKo)\]  
Please share it — it may be removed soon. This is very serious. He is the one who operates in the shadows, the one who gave the orders to Visa and Mastercard and the one who pressured Steam and the other platforms

Jon Stewart was the only late night host to mention Elon Musk’s Nazi salute today. Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, none of them mentioned it at all in their show tonight. I never thought I would say this but I’m only getting my news from Comedy Central from now on.

At the time of this posting;

NBC News called it “Elon Musk gestures to inauguration crowd in what some on social media liken to a Nazi salute”;

ABC News has an 8 mins video titled “President Trump promises Elon Musk will achieve his greatest wish” and used a clip of Elon Musk shouting “Yes” during the very same speech, still no report on the Nazi salute on ABC News YT channel to this moment;

AP titled Elon’s entire speech as “Elon Musk celebrates at a Trump Inauguration Day viewing party”;

Washington Post cut out his first salute and only shown the second one when he’s facing away from the camera, titled “Elon Musk gives exuberant speech at inauguration”

Edit:

Forgot to mention, as of 10 am Eastern 1/21/25

Presti :

&gt; There's certainly something to be learned from the injuries. I think it's a couple years in a row now that we've been in the postseason and the best players on certain teams aren't playing, you know.

I think we're kind of bordering on a level of, like, it's almost insulting, you know. It doesn't mean it's anyone's fault. It doesn't mean we don't want our best players playing every single night. It's not a matter of players not wanting to play or being soft or anything like that. But I don't think we should be putting our head in the sand and acting as if there's no correlation. 

&gt; The reason why is because if we're pointing to data, the data is from 20 years ago or 10 years ago. The game is totally different sport than it was even several years ago because of the amount of poss

**Dan**: Does the show look like the same show? Is it just *Inside the NBA* but on ESPN?

**Charles**: Dan, we don’t even know. That’s one of the reasons I was waiting. TNT is trying to do something stupid behind the scenes. We taped a pilot about a month ago, and it was the stupidest s\*\*t I’ve ever seen in my life.

**Dan**: What do you mean you taped a pilot?

**Charles**: We're only probably going to be working for ESPN like half the time, maybe a third of the time. So TNT wants to do something too. We taped a pilot, and it was the stupidest thing ever.

# Ethel Cain July 9 Statement

To start things off, I want to address the Twitter/curiouscat screenshots. That was my account and they were my words. I was 19 and I was entirely aware of what I was saying and that was why I said it. I spent my later high-school years being extremely progressive and “SJW” as they called it at the time, as a way to reject the indoctrination of my environment and rebel against the prejudice, hatred, and ignorance of the culture I grew up in. After moving out of my parents’ house, I fell into a subculture online that prioritized garnering attention at all costs. I flip-flopped again, rejecting all notions of my former “cringe SJW” behavior and intended to be as inflammatory and controversial as possible. I would have said (and usually did say) anything, about anyone, to gain attention and ultimately

Important read on current efforts to gut our government programs.  Please share EVERYWHERE. 

Report from the Senate Floor:

“Last night in the Senate, something really important happened. Republicans forced us to debate their billionaire bailout budget framework. We started voting at 6 PM because they knew doing it in the dark of night would minimize media coverage. And they do not want the American people to see how blatant their handover of our government to the billionaire class is. 

So I want to explain what happened last night and what we did to fight back. The apex of Republicans’ plan to turn over our government to their wealthy cronies is a giant tax cut for billionaires and corporations. And they plan to pay for it with cuts to programs that working people rely on. Popular and necessary programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP, are all being targeted. 

In order to pass the tax cut, Republicans have to go through a series of procedural steps. Last night, they took the firs

Andrea Stella has provided a further statement about the swap between Lando and Oscar in Italy.

He states that it was always intended to pit Oscar first once they had run so long on the medium tyres. I'm not sure I buy into this. I'm an Aussie and Oscar fan, as well as McLaren. If Lando wins WDC, so be it. I think he was the stronger driver for the Monza weekend out of the two.

Why YSK: you can use the transcript to navigate through the video. 

YouTube has full transcripts available for all videos (at least any video with captions available.) This means that you can use the transcript go back to a specific line rather than just scrubbing through and hoping for the best. (Btw, you can use YouTube  as a completely free basic transcription.)

If you're on the app the transcript is very easy to access but on desktop it is in that extra buttons menu at the end of the button list below the video, but it really shouldn't be hidden away like that because it's fantastic.

**Important Editor's note: DPH is another name for Benadryl, generic name diphenhydramine. It's an over-the-counter allergy medicine that is sometimes used as a sleep aid. Apparently, when taken in high enough doses, it can also act as a hallucinogen and a delirient. It is strongly advised that you DO NOT TRY THIS.**

&gt; “If there's two things that have made Toronto not a place that Mitch Marner is all that eager to keep playing in, it would be his original contract negotiation back in 2019, which he and his camp extended into training camp. He signed after a day or two of missing camp that year. But that's when the fans started to turn on him.”

&gt; “And, you know, Mitch gave interviews at that time, said it was the first time he'd ever been yelled at. He was walking his dog once, and some guy that summer was yelling like, “why don't you have a contract?”. And people started talking a lot about his dad and what role his dad may or may not have played in those negotiations.”

&gt; “And Mitch kind of bristled at his family being brought into it. And then on top of that, in the six years that followed, when the playoff success wasn't there, you know, a lot of it was aimed his way. And I will say, much of it justified, but I'm aware of a few

While browsing youtube the other day and brushing up on the latest news, I started watching a video on the White House’s official youtube channel (@WhiteHouse) that’s titled “President Trump Holds a Press Conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel”, posted on February 4th, 2025. 

Typically, I like to watch content with the subtitles on (when available), so I turned on the captions for this video, as I would any other. I was working and listening to the video as it played in the background, but then I looked up and noticed something strange. The words in the subtitles weren’t matching up at all with what was being said in the video. At first I thought, this must be a glitch, or it’s picking up random words from some other video on YouTube. Curious about it, I scrolled back to the beginning of the video and started reading the captions from the beginning (I will be including the full transcript below).

After the recent fandom explosion over the SAG-AFTRA (SAG) video game strike, I and some fellow lore nerds embarked on a deep-dive into the intricacies of unions, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) which legalizes unionization in the US, and how it applies to the voice acting (VA) industry.

We spoke directly to SAG representatives (although we weren't able to speak to SAG Interactive, which is behind the strike) and industry insiders (ones who aren't VAs and don't have any stake on SAG issues), and we also perused hundreds of articles and websites to expand our knowledge about the issue. However, like everyone else who's posted on the issue, we are not lawyers specializing in union contracts. This post is a simplified overview of the situation based on a wide array of sources; the NLRA is deliberately vague, and specific applications need to be decided in court.

I decided to start putting this together last night because I realized that a lot of the information that I and others were getting about the case was getting filtered through a very long game of telephone. I could not find anywhere on the internet where all of the information released so far could be viewed in a seamless manner, so I decided to spend a few hours putting it together myself.

I've collected all of the sworn ~~testimonies~~ affidavits, along with statements by relevant parties and other smaller details. I was originally using [this article](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/deshaun-watson-lawsuit-details/285-42abe4a4-44a9-4acc-b84b-1f18579dff15) for the summaries of each lawsuit, but a few cases into this project I realized that those summaries leave out a lot of important details and some of the JANE DOE's don't match-up, so I ended up drafting most of the summaries myself. I sometimes still used their summary as a skeleton to build off of, so if some of the summa

My favorite probably has to be, "can you tell me what the main point of this paragraph is in only a couple of sentences?".

For me, it's incredibly useful if I'm reading a lengthy textbook, and I'm too lazy to try and understand the main idea. Even if it doesn't give a 100% accurate response, it'll still point me in the right direction.

Another one I really like is summarizing transcripts from YouTube videos by using this prompt: "can you summarize this transcription of a YouTube video for me?". YouTube has a feature where you can copy the transcript from a video if it has captions available. If it's a tutorial that's pretty lengthy/wordy, you can use the above prompt to shorten it, so you don't waste your time trying to figure out what they are trying to convey.

EDIT: Seems like people are wondering how I'm able to fit large amounts of text into ChatGPT, whether it's a YouTube video or some kind of book. I don't. I only feed it the parts I need summarized. Hope this cleared up any m

That is, Goldman Sachs, at the direction of Paulson, hand-picked mortgages that were certain to go bad, and stuffed the mortgages (or rather, “synthetic” derivatives of the mortgages) into collateralized debt obligations that temporarily masked the true value of the loans.

Quotes: 
"If the info about Call of Duty is accurate [about it launching on the next gen Xbox in 2026], there is no devkit right now. So like the idea that developers have already gotten the next-gen Xbox's dev kit… that's just not accurate." 

"I mean the whole idea of the next Xbox is that it's gonna be a PC in essence but with a TV friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind, so developers will be building for Windows PC in a way but in such a way that they know exactly what the specs will be. So maybe the Call of Duty rumor could be right but if it is, the dev kit talk is more about what kind of specs that they've been told to target for the next Xbox, not about having any dev kit." 

"But I'm pretty sure new hardware is not 2026, it's 2027."

Trainwreck: The Astroworld Tragedy was released today (June 10th). Directed by Yemi Bamiro, it views the tragic events that unfolded at Astroworld 2021 through the stories of some survivors, event workers at the festival (like security guards and medics) and people who worked for LiveNation, like photographers.

I'm not here to criticize the documentary or the director. And you can't really criticize anything from the documentary either given these people were firsthand witnesses of the festival. With that sidenote, I might add that,

Hi! I did a huge deep dive on the DWD drama a while ago and was asked to do others and said I would. Since then, all hell broke lose.

I talked about this with some people privately, but I mentioned in my first post that I was a stan, just not of anyone involved in the drama. Well, I was a Taylor Swift stan. **Was** being the operative word. I'm once again using by throwaway account because I was warned by people who I reached out to privately of the horrible things people have been telling them since they called Matty out. I used to be a huge Swiftie, and I wasn't that careful with my personal data when participating in conversations, so I need to be careful.

I'm tired of seeing Tay's new boo defended and the excuses people make about him, so my second deep dive is exposing him for the dirtbag he's been his whole career, how he refuses to apologize or gives terrible apologies when he does. How he repeats the same "mistakes" over and over, etc. I know there's been a ton of threads abo

Hey everyone,

This is kind of a wild piece of family history, and I’m hoping the collective wisdom here can help me out. My dad, Ralph Samuel Cohen, was actually one of the executive producers and directors on that infamous Michael Jackson Pepsi commercial where Michael’s hair caught on fire in 1984. During the incident, my dad was one of the first people on stage and ended up putting his jacket over Michael’s hair to help put out the flames. Funny enough, it was an Armani jacket, which is just a quirky detail, but the crazy part is some of Michael’s singed hair ended up stuck to it. After the whole thing, Michael actually thanked my dad personally and even wrote him a letter, which we still have. My dad also did a TV interview about it back then, and I’ve got the tape that I plan to digitize. Michael was cool with my dad keeping the hair as a sort of memento since they had already worked together previously! My dad also did the beat it music video and Jackson 5 Pepsi commercials and

Senator Bernie Sanders put out a video on Monday that is aimed at left-wing voters that feel they can't vote for Kamala due to the conflict in Gaza.

[YouTube - Bernie Sanders: “I disagree with Kamala’s position on the war in Gaza. How can I vote for her?” Here is my answer:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf5MThSniiY) (Transcript in comments)

He makes the case that even though Harris and Biden's position isn't ideal, they are far better than Trump on the Gaza. 
He says Netanyahu would much prefer Trump in office, "who is extremely close to Netanyahu and sees him as a like-minded, right wing extremist ally."

He also makes the case that there are other issues at stake in this election, such as women's bodily autonomy, climate change, and wealth inequality.

If Senator Sanders correct in his views?

Will this video change any minds among those who view the Biden-Harris administration in too negative a light to vote for Kamala Harris?

I repeat again. When these kinds of remasters are announced, remasters of the old Gears games are going to be able to be cross-platform play simultaneously. The only thing I haven't been able to confirm is the launch of a Switch version but it can be played cross-platform on PC, Xbox and PlayStation.

Hey guys, on June 10th Chovy did an informal AMA stream but I haven't seen any transcriptions of it, so I made one using software. Here you go.



### **Chovy's June 2025 Q&amp;A Session - English Translation**

**Q: Is there a place you want to travel to overseas? Or do you prefer a vacation spot for relaxation or for activities?**

**Chovy:** Can I say something like this? The place I want to go, whether overseas or for vacation... I don't need any of that. I want to go home. For me, just going home is as difficult as traveling overseas.

*(Fan Donation: HaniSyu-nim, thank you for 100 star balloons! Message: "Long time no see.")*

**Chovy:** Hey, I'm just being honest. What can I do? Look, if I were at home all the time, I'd want to travel overseas too. But I spend more time overseas than I do at home. In a year, yes. I spend more of the year overseas than at my own home.

**Q: Can you share a playlist you've been listening to on repeat? I'm curious what you listen to.**

EDIT: Turns out what I'm really missing is the extra "N" in "Rossmann". Whoops! Fixed the rest of the post.

I listened to Rossmann's entire hour-long hit piece, and I couldn't help but want to straighten out some of the story behind this back-and-forth communication about LTX travel and a broken motherboard that he spent a significant amount of time talking about. There are other parts of Rossmann's video this post doesn't touch base on.

Given Rossmann did an hour-long hit piece, my opinions in this post are targeted at him in response. I was inspired to review this because I have a history with people like Rossmann and it was therapeutic to break this down, and could do so while my newborn was sleeping on my chest with little else to do :).

I will refer to Louis Rossmann as just "Rossmann" to avoid the whole Linus/Louis confusion when reading.

EDIT: As pointed out in the comments, Rossmann was at LTX 2023. Something worth keeping in mind while reading this.

I’ve been watching a lot of Huberman Lab videos lately, especially the longer ones, and I usually copy the full transcript into ChatGPT to summarise or search through key points.

But copying the transcript manually from YouTube is kind of a hassle—open the transcript window, scroll forever, select everything, and hope it doesn’t bug out. I tried some of those AI summariser extensions, but they didn’t really work the way I wanted. I prefer having the full transcript and working with it directly.

So I ended up building a Chrome extension for myself that lets you copy or download the full YouTube transcript with one click. You can strip out timestamps, include the video title, even add a custom prompt for ChatGPT if you want it all copied together.

It’s just something I made for my own use, but it’s been super helpful. I figured I’d share the idea here in case others do something similar or would find this kind of thing useful too. Not trying to promote anything—just curious how others

There is this pressure to present yourself in the right way. When my transfer came about, it was a little strange. I knew it was a world record then, but I never really thought about it.

Hello gamedev subreddit!

Me and my friend [PeDev](https://twitter.com/PeDev_) recently transcribed all publicly available GDC YouTube videos using a robust transcription tool called Whisper. You can access the transcript by visiting [https://dklassic.github.io/GDC-transcript](https://dklassic.github.io/GDC-transcript) and enter the YouTube video ID.

[https://imgur.com/Oy00T2O](https://imgur.com/Oy00T2O)

[https://imgur.com/wDGLlQQ](https://imgur.com/wDGLlQQ)

The tool was developed with the following use case in mind:

* For a quick glance at the content before diving in
* To be able to text search GDC content
* To bypass contents with bad audio or bad mixing
* To help with some heavily accented talks
* For non-natives to have an easily accessible way to use machine assisted translation

Please help share the tool to whatever community that might find use of this tool, ~~and if GDC DMCAed me for some reason (I think this is well within fair use but anyways) then at least I had a good

## 90. YSK to avoid “for profit” universities like DeVry University and UPhoenix. They are known for scamming their students and giving unaccredited degrees.

**Content:**
Recently there has been a surge in commercials on YouTube and on the internet for colleges such as DeVry University and the Art Institutes.

Despite how attractive these schools appear in commercials, these “universities” are FOR PROFIT. This means that they exist to give shareholders and the CEO of the “university” money. These places do not focus on educating their students or doing research. Recruiters will often accept students to these colleges without looking at transcripts or other reports. They will also lie to you and try to lure you in to their institution. 

Most students who attend for-profits end up in mountains of debt, with a useless degree, and with tons of wasted time. The “degrees” given by these colleges are completely useless and many employers do not accept them. Credits at these schools don't transfer either, so you won't be able to continue your education elsewhere.

When you apply to college, make sure you look up whether it is for-profit, non-profit, or public.

## 91. About a week ago, the post "Youtube's algorithm brings me this blessing gift" featured advice on allowing others to not like you. I loved it so much that I transcribed the video so that I could place a copy on my wall. Here is that transcription if you'd like to do the same.

Not everyone is going to like you. Not everyone is going to accept you, or appreciate you. In fact, there will be many who dislike you, who will judge you, criticise you, and that's just the way it is. You can't please everyone.

Now certainly, we should be considerate of others. We should be respectful, and we should be watchful of our own behaviour, and if someone criticises us, it may be worth reflecting upon it to see if perhaps there is something we may need to address in our behaviour. But even if you're the kindest, gentlest, sweetest, most respectful person on the planet, there's simply going to be those who will find all kinds of reasons not to like you, and you just have to accept that. 

What I've found to be a really powerful piece of advice is to simply allow others the freedom not to like you, to allow them the freedom to disagree with you, to judge you, to think less of you. After all, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if that opinion is entirely baseless.

I'll return with some summary in an edit to this post.

At the beginning of the video Lady C gives extensive comments (about 30 min) about Harry's drug use.  (start at about 10:56)  Some pithy thoughts:

* Harold is plainly using drugs to self-medicate and thinks Harry could qualify as an addict.  It’s good that Harry has been so forthcoming about his drug use because it clarifies why his family has been concerned and shows the public what they have dealt with. 
* Not everyone suffers from distorted thought processes when using marijuana but Lady C things it could be argued that Harry has. Sadly, it makes you more amenable to persuasion by people who appear to be sympathetic.  (ahem, Mehen)
* 17:11  Anyone who is married to someone that’s abusing drugs -- to the extent they abuse their family, attack their nation and one of the olde
